## Starting openEQUELLA

### Windows

1. In the windows command prompt, navigate to  **<install_location>/manager**
2. To register openEQUELLA as a windows service type **equellaserver install**
3. To start the openEQUELLA service type **equellaserver start**

### \*nix
```bash
~$ cd {install_location}/manager
~$ ./equellaserver start
and/or
~$ ./manager start
```
To stop openEQUELLA, run the same command to start the application, but pass in 'stop' instead of 'start'.

**Note:** The primary log to watch is located under: 

`{install_location}/logs/resource-centre/{current_date}/application.{X.}html`



## Accessing openEQUELLA / Finish Setup
Once openEQUELLA has started you can log into the server admin pages using the hostname and port you configured in the installer.

The installation process will need to be completed in the server admin pages. Please access the server admin pages, configure the fields presented, and once presented with the database screen, initialize the database.

At this point, openEQUELLA is 'running', but still needs an institution to be useful.



## Import an Institution
1. Download the preconfigured [institution](https://github.com/equella/equella.github.io/blob/master/guides/6.4VanillaReferenceInstitution.tgz).
1. Using the server admin pages, import the institution
1. After the import completes, click '**Return to Institution Management**'
1. Your newly imported institution should be enabled on the '**Institutions**' page.  Click '**Login**' under '**Actions**'
1. Login with the openEQUELLA super user **TLE_ADMINISTRATOR**, and use the institution password you set when configuring the institution import.
