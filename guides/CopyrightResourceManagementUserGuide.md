## Copyright compliance overview

The EQUELLA copyright compliance features do not restrict the amount of copyright material
that can be contributed to the repository: they do restrict the amount of copied content
which can be active at any time – i.e. copyright compliant content cannot be viewed by course users until it has been activated. Any number of resources can be active at a
particular time as long as they comply with Part VB of the Australian Copyright Act 1968 (as amended) and the New Zealand Copyright Act 1994 (and subsequent amendments). 

The purpose of this guide is to provide content contributors, such as lecturers, teachers librarians and content administrators with examples of the copyright resource contribution, activation, management and reporting process.

Please note that this guide has been developed to best reflect the full capabilities of EQUELLA and as such may differ in appearance to your own installation and as it is based on Australian and New Zealand Copyright regulations it will have varying levels of applicability around the
world. Contact the system administrator for access to extra features or to reconfigure your installation.

Where possible the examples in this guide use the Collections, Contribution Wizards and
Power Searches provided in the EQUELLA Vanilla Institution. (Note: There are no workflows associated with these vanilla collections and hence the resources do not go through a moderation process.)

### Contribute copyright compliant resources
EQUELLA enables users to create, manage and search for copyright compliant content
such as images, audio, video, packaged content, web links, text, PDF and MS Office™
documents.

### Training tasks
In this guide, the user will:
* Contribute resources to the EQUELLA Digital Repository:
  * Contribute a holding resource using the federated search method;
  * Contribute a holding resource using the library search method;
  * Contribute portion resources.
* Activate the portion resources.
* Browse for activated resources.
* Perform a Power Search to find contributed resources.
* Manage the activated resources.
* Generate a copyright report.

## Contribute resources
EQUELLA copyright compliance management involves interrelated collections.

Typically these include two separate holding collections to easily differentiate the types of copyright content and are typically a book collection and a journal collection. The holding collections contain holding resources that consist of information (metadata) about the resource such as book or journal details.

The portion collection stores portion resources that each contain copyright content such as the scanned chapter of a book or article from a journal. During contribution the portion resources are linked to the appropriate holding resource. 

In this section the user will contribute a resource a resource to the book holding collection then contribute portion resources that are linked to the book holding resource.

## EQUELLA Digital Repository
To access EQUELLA
1. Open a browser and enter your EQUELLA URL (e.g. http://equella.myinstitution.edu)
and log in.

The examples in this section are as follows:
* Contribute a holding resource (e.g. Rights and inequality in Australian education) to
the holding collection (e.g. Books).
* Contribute various portion resources (e.g. Chapters 2 & 4) to the portion collection
(e.g. eReserve articles) and link them to the appropriate source resource (e.g. Rights
and inequality in Australian education) in the holding collection (e.g. Books).

### Contribute holding resources
Resources that are contributed to holding collections only contain information (metadata). This is typically records of books and journals and includes details such as titles, authors, editors etc.

The first step is to contribute a resource (e.g. Rights and inequality in Australian
education) to the holding collection (e.g. Books). When contributing a resource, for
example a book to a holding collection the resource can be added using the following
methods:
* Holding collection contribution wizard—allows users to manually add information
and contribute a resource to the selected holding collection.
* Remote repository—allows users to search for records from a variety of external
sources such as a library database. 
Information for the resource can automatically be imported into a contribution wizard saving time and increasing accuracy.

Because a holding resource must exist for every contributed portion resource, holding
resources can also be contributed during the portion resource contribution process using
the following methods:
* Remote repository/Library search—allows users to search for records from a
variety of external repositories and automatically import information from Z3950
sources into a contribution wizard for the selected holding type.
* Contribution wizard—allows users to manually add information and contribute a
resource to the holding collection for the selected holding type.

### Contribution wizard contribution method
Each resource that is contributed is saved in a customised collection and each collection
belongs to a category.

To contribute a resource to a collection
1. Select Contribute from the navigation menu. The Contribute page displays with a
list of categories and collections. 
2. Select a collection from the list (e.g. Books in the Demonstration category) to display the Contribution Wizard associated with the selected collection. 

(NOTE: Holding resources only contain details about the book or journal.)

### Remote repository/library search contribution method

A remote repository search allows users to search multiple external sources such as
university library databases and choose to have the returned results automatically added
to fields in the holding collection wizard. Using remote repositories can increase accuracy and is quicker than entering information manually. 

To search for source information
1. Select Search from the navigation menu. The Search page displays.
2. Click the Within drop-down and select the appropriate remote repository (e.g. Books –
Libraries Australia) from the Remote repositories category.

The Books – Libraries Australia remote repository page displays.

Select Title from the Where drop-down, enter a search term in the search box (e.g.
australian education) then click Search to display a list of search results. 

3. Select an appropriate resource (e.g. Rights and inequality in Australian education) to
display detailed results. 

#### To automatically add information to the holding collection wizard
4. Click Import to display the holding collection (e.g. Books) contribution wizard with some fields automatically populated with information returned from the search. 

The contribution wizard is used to gather information relating to the contributed resource.

#### To complete the contribution process
5. Enter all required information for the resource being contributed.
6. Review the information then click Save to display a confirmation dialog.
7. Click Publish to display the Resource summary page. 

The next step is to add portion resources (e.g. Chapters 2 & 4) to the portion collection (e.g. eReserve articles) and link them to the holding resource (e.g. Rights and inequality in Australian education) in the holding collection (e.g. Books).

## Contribute portion resources
Resources that are contributed to portion collections contain the content. This is typically scanned or copied extracts from books or journal articles.

When contributing a portion resource such as a book chapter or journal article to the
portion collection, it must be linked to an appropriate book or journal source resource in the holding collection.

#### To contribute resources to the portion collection
1. Select Contribute from the navigation menu then select the portions collection (e.g.
eReserve articles) to display the portion collection contribution wizard. 

Portion resources are typically scanned or copied files that can be attached to the
resource.

#### To add an attachment
1. Select the resource type (e.g. File).
2. Click the Add a resource link to browse for and add the scanned or copied file (e.g.
Education comparisons.docx). Note that only one file can be attached. 
3. Enter the Page range (e.g. 12-23). An example is shown in Figure 10.
4. Select a category from the Copyright Status drop-down list (e.g. Copyright) to
display controls for the selected type. 

In the example collection, book chapters or journal articles can be added. Selecting a
Book holding type displays different fields to selecting a Journal holding type.

#### To add an additional section
1. Click the Add Additional Section button and repeat steps 1-4 above.

#### To select the holding type
1. Select the holding type from the Type drop-down list (e.g. Book extract) to display
controls relevant to the selected type. 

#### To link the portion resource to the holding resource
1. Click the Add a resource link in the Select Book section to display the Select page with the search. 

Existing EQUELLA holding resources can be selected using the Search, Recent or
Browse portlets.

When an existing holding resource cannot be located it can be added using the
Contribute options available from the Select page. 

#### To find a previously contributed holding resource
1. Either:

a. Enter appropriate search criteria (e.g. australian education) in the Search box then
click the search button to display the results page, Or

b. Select a resource from the Recent portlet to display the Resource summary page within the Select page. 

2. Select the appropriate holding resource (e.g. Rights and inequality in Australian
education) to display the Resource summary page within the Select page. 
3. Click Select Item . The My selections page displays. 
4. Click Return Selection. The Edit resource details dialog displays.
5. Click Save. The Book displays in the Selection table, with Edit, Replace and Delete links.
6. Enter the required information in the Chapter Number, Author, Title, Description
and From where does this originate? fields, if relevant.
7. Click the Save button, then select to display the Resource summary page, with the holding resources details displayed. 
8. Add at least one more portion resource (e.g. Chapter 4, The inequality debate) to the Rights and inequality in Australian education holding resource.

### Resource activation rules
Typically a portion resource can be activated using the following rules:
* For books—only 10% or one chapter of a book can be activated at the one time. When a chapter number is not entered then the resource can only be activated if its portion size is less than 10% of the book. The chapter number can be a Roman numeral, a decimal and include alphabetic characters, examples such as: vi, IV, XX,
table 9.6, Appendix 3, Introduction, 19 fact sheet, 1.10.
* For journals—only one article from a journal can be activated at one time unless
multiple articles have the same topic and then they can all be activated.

#### To view the holding resource with associated portion resources
1. Select My resources from the navigation menu.
2. Select the holding resource (e.g. Rights and inequality in Australian education) to
display the Resource Summary page. 

The Resource summary confirms that the two portion resources (Chapters 2 & 4) contributed to the eReserve articles collection are linked to the appropriate Books holding resource (Rights and inequality in Australian education). The Total pages, Total percentage, Active total and, Inactive total, portion percentage and activation status for the holding resource and the portion resources are displayed. In this example, all of the chapters are currently Inactive.

Once portion resources are contributed to the portions collection and linked to the parent
holding resource they can be activated. 
## Contribute holding resources during the portion contribution wizard

When a portion contribution wizard includes a resource selector control and the holding
resource does not exist, it can be contributed using the following methods:
* Contribution wizard—allows users to manually add information and contribute a
resource to the holding collection for the selected holding type. Clicking the Add a resource link in the holding resource selection field, then selecting from
the Contribute portlet on the Select page opens the holding resource contribution
wizard. 
* Remote repository/Library search—allows users to search for records from a
variety of external sources and automatically import information from Z3950 sources
into a contribution wizard for the selected holding type. Clicking the Add a resource
link in the holding resource selection field, then clicking the Search icon in the Search portlet
* Click Search Other Repositories and select a remote repository to search. 

## Activate resources
The copyright compliance features do not restrict the amount of copyright material that can be contributed to the repository but do restrict the amount of copied content active at any time to that allowed by CAL, simplifying management of copyright materials.

Managed copyright compliant content cannot be viewed by course users until it has been
activated for a course.

In this section the user will activate two chapters from the same book against the EQUELLA 101 course. One chapter is activated, however, the other chapter is not as it violates the copyright requirements.

### Activate resources
Any number of resources can be active at a particular time as long as they comply with
Part VB of the Australian Copyright Act 1968 (as amended). Content is activated when it
is added to a course. Activation is initiated from the Resource summary page of the holding resource or the Resource summary page of
the portion resources.

In this section resources are activated from the portion resource summary page.

### Activate a portion resource
1. Select My Resources from the navigation menu.
2. Click on a portion resource to activate (e.g. The inequality debate) to display the
Resource summary page. 

#### To activate a single portion resource
1. Select the checkbox for the portion in the Copyright section, then click Activate to display the Activate attachments page. 
 

#### To activate multiple portion resources
1. Select the checkboxes for the relevant portions then click the Activate Selected
button. (Note: When multiple portions are selected they cannot be activated if their
combined size violates the copyright portion rules such as 10% of a book.)

Activation requires that course and time frame details are entered, as the content is only made available to course users for the specified dates.

To link the portion resource to a course
1. Select a Course from the drop-down list (e.g. EQUELLA 101).
2. Select Make live from and Make live until dates for the resource to be available
online.
3. Select a Citation from the drop-down list (e.g. Generic).
4. Click Activate to display the Resource summary page with Active portion resource.

NOTE: If the chapter is over 10% of the book the system allows the user to activate it
because it is still only one chapter.

Activation signals to the copyright compliance features that content usage is now
recorded and copyright compliance enforced.

Activation records the following information:
* Portion resources activated
* Course details including the number of users
* Period of use.

### Activate another portion resource
To confirm that the activation triggers are working, another portion resource from the
same holding resource needs to be activated. The system should display an error
message and the portion resource should not be allowed to be made active.

1. Select the My Resources option and select a different portion resource to activate
(e.g. Comparing educational requirements) to display the Resource summary page.
2. Select the checkbox for the portion then click Activate to display the Activate
Attachments page.
3. Select the course (e.g. EQUELLA 101) and Make live from and until dates for the
resource to be available online then click Activate .

Because the portion violates both the 10% and one chapter CAL rules a Copyright problem page is displayed. 

4. Respond appropriately to the message, for example email the content administrator.
5. Click OK.

The portion resources can also be activated from the Resource summary page of the
holding resource.

## Copyright agreements
Users must accept the agreement conditions to view the portion resource. 

### Perform advanced search
A collection can comprise hundreds of resources and an advanced search can be a very useful tool for finding activated resources.

There are multiple search options in the example advanced search, one option or any
combination of options can be used to find a resource.

#### To use an advanced search to find a resource
1. Select Search from the navigation menu. The Search page displays.
2. Click the Within drop-down list and select the relevant advanced search (e.g.
eReserve) from the Advanced search category.
3. Enter the appropriate search information (e.g. Copyright).
4. Click Search to display the results. 

## Manage activations
Administrators can conveniently control activated resources through the Manage Activations function and the resource’s Copyright page.

All previously activated resources are displayed on the Manage Activations page and the resource’s Activations page. Resources can be deactivated, deleted or rolled-over from the Manage Activations page and deleted from the resource’s Activations page. In this section the user will use the Rollover Activations feature to deactivate an activated resource and then activate it against a new course.

### Administer activations
Activated resources can be managed from the Manage Activation page and the resource’s Activation page.
### Manage Activations page
