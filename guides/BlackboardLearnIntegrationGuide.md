## EQUELLA Blackboard Learn integration overview
EQUELLA integrates easily with Blackboard Learn™ (Blackboard) by using the EQUELLA Blackboard Building Block to create a seamless system for users. Additionally the EQUELLA Shared Secret functionality provides a single sign-on for users.

The purpose of this guide is to provide system administrators with an understanding of the EQUELLA Blackboard integration process to enable successful integration. 

Please note that this guide has been developed for Blackboard version 9.1 (SP16) and, as such, may differ in appearance to your own installation. 

## Prerequisites
To successfully complete this installation the system administrator will require:
* Sufficient privileges to access the Blackboard system integration functionality.
* Sufficient privileges to access the EQUELLA User Management functionality 

System prerequisites for integration
* EQUELLA version 6.4 and Blackboard version 9.1 (SP16) must be installed and running.
* Ensure the time settings of the servers have the correct time and time zone for their location. This way both will report to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) and synchronize correctly.
* To access the EQUELLA Home page at least one course must have been created in Blackboard. Refer to the Blackboard documentation for more information. 

## Integration procedure
EQUELLA Blackboard integration can be broken into the following steps:
1.  Register an LTI OAuth Client in EQUELLA.
2.  Configure and enable the Shared Secret in the EQUELLA User Management tool.
3.  Download the Blackboard Building Block from the EQUELLA Institution Manager.
4.  Upload the building block into Blackboard.
5.  Activate the EQUELLA Plugin in Blackboard.
6.  Test the installation.

## Configure EQUELLA 
This section describes the required configuration changes to EQUELLA to support a seamless integration. To achieve this, an EQUELLA LTI OAuth Client Application needs to be registered, along with a Shared Secret configuration.
### Register an LTI consumer
LTI consumer client registrations are registered from the Settings page in EQUELLA.

To create a new LTI consumer
1.  Select Settings from the navigation menu, and either type LTI in the filter box, then select LTI consumers from the results or scroll down to LTI consumers on the Settings list. The LTI consumers page displays. 
2.  Select the Create new LTI consumer link to open the Create new LTI consumer page. 
3.  Enter a Title (e.g. Canvas) and a Description (optional).
4.  A default Consumer key displays. This can be changed as desired (e.g. canvas). Take note as the Consumer key is entered in Canvas during integration configuration.
5.  A default Consumer secret displays. This can be changed as desired. Take note as the Client secret is entered in Canvas during integration configuration.
6. Other options can be enabled as required. 

### LTI/LIS Role Mappings
Canvas roles sent through to EQUELLA via the LTI integration need to be mapped to equivalent EQUELLA roles so that relevant privileges can be applied. This is done from the LTI/LIS Role Mappings section of the Add new LTI consumer or Edit LTI consumer pages. 

The LTI/LIS Role Mappings section has three areas:
* Instructor role – map the ‘Teacher’ role to EQUELLA role/s.
* Other roles –this area is used to map all other roles that might be used in the integration. A list of the standard LTI/LIS roles is supplied.
* Unknown roles – use this area to select the EQUELLA roles to default to when an unknown role is sent to EQUELLA. 

### Mapping the Instructor and Unknown roles
In the Instructor and Unknown roles fields, the Add roles link is used to select the EQUELLA roles to be used in the mappings. An example using the Instructor role is used below:

To map to EQUELLA role/s
1.  Click the Add roles link under the Instructor role field. The Select role(s) dialog displays. 
2.  Enter a search query then click Search. Matching results display. 
3.  Select the required role/s, then click Select these roles . The mapping/s displays in the Instructor role field. Select the Add roles link to add more mappings.

### Mapping other roles
The Other roles section is used to map LTI/LIS standard roles and other custom roles to EQUELLA roles. 

To map other roles
1.  In the Other roles area, start typing the required LTI/LIS role (e.g. Student) in the Enter LTI/LIS role field. A list of all the standard LTI/LIS roles displays in a drop-down list. 
2.  Select the required value (e.g. Student) from the drop-down list.
3.  Click the Add roles link next to the selected LTI/LIS role. 
The Select role(s) dialog displays. 
4.  Enter a search query then click Search. Matching results display. 
5.  Select the required role/s, then click Select these roles. The mapping/s displays in the Other roles field. 

To add further EQUELLA roles to the Other roles that have existing mappings or to add another LTI/LIS role mapping, repeat steps 1 to 5.
 
### Configure a shared secret
Shared secrets are configured in the EQUELLA Administration Console. 
NOTE: The shared secret is used in the EQUELLA portal functionality outlined below.

To configure a shared secret
1.  Open a browser and enter your EQUELLA URL (e.g. ‘http://equella.myequellainstitution.edu’).
2.  Log in to EQUELLA as an administrator, select Settings then Administration console. 
3. The Administration console displays. Select User Management to display a list of plug-ins. 
4.  Highlight the Shared Secrets user management plug-in, then click Configure. The Shared Secrets dialog displays.
5.  Click Add to create a new shared secret. The Shared Secrets dialog now displays a new shared secret named ‘DEFAULT’ in the left hand pane, and the configuration elements to the right of the pane. 
6.  Enter a unique Identifier (ID) (e.g. blackboard). 
7.  Enter a Shared Secret (e.g. bbS3cr3t). The secret may be any combination of characters and numbers, but strings longer than eight characters consisting of upper and lower case alphanumeric characters are recommended. 
8.  Make a note of the identifier and shared secret; they will be needed to complete the Enable the EQUELLA Plugin section.
Other options can be enabled as required. 
9.  Click Save.
10.  Click Close to close the dialog.
The Shared Secrets plug-in must be enabled (checked). If not already, enable the plug-in:
1.  Check the Enabled checkbox for the Shared Secret plug-in. 
2.  Click Yes to confirm.
3.  Click Exit Console  to close the Administration Console.

NOTE: Only trusted users should be able to see the shared secret, as this information can be used to impersonate any user within EQUELLA.

The next step in the integration process is to download the Blackboard Building Block. 

## Configure Blackboard 
This section describes the required configuration changes to Blackboard to support the integration. EQUELLA provides a Building Block tool that allows Blackboard users to easily contribute, search and select EQUELLA content and link them to a course. 
### Download the EQUELLA Blackboard Building Block
