## Canvas Learning Management System and EQUELLA

EQUELLA is an advanced digital repository that can be integrated with the Canvas learning management system. From within Canvas, users can access the EQUELLA repository to search, create and manage content such as images, audio, video, packaged content, web links, text, PDFs and Microsoft Office™ documents. Content can then be incorporated into Canvas courses.
The purpose of this guide is to demonstrate to users how to integrate EQUELLA resources using Canvas. Users will learn how to search for, create and manage available resources, and how to add these materials to courses. For information on configuring EQUELLA in Canvas, refer to the EQUELLA Canvas Configuration Guide.

Please note that this guide has been developed using EQUELLA version 6.3 (GA) and Canvas and as such may differ in appearance to your own installation. Contact your system administrator for access to extra features or to reconfigure your installation.

## Canvas homepage and course page
Log in to Canvas to display the Canvas homepage.

Courses can be viewed and selected by selecting the Courses drop-down at the top of the page. 

Click Modules from the course page navigation menu to view the course modules and existing content. 

## Adding content to Canvas course modules

EQUELLA content can be added to Canvas course modules in two ways:
* Selecting the Select resources from EQUELLA option from the course navigation menu. Using this option opens the EQUELLA Integration screen, which lists all the Canvas course modules on the right, and allows the user to search for and select multiple resources to add to one or more course modules. 
* Selecting the PLUS button beside a specific course module from the Modules page. Using this option allows the user to select EQUELLA as an external tool, and add a single resource to the selected module. S

## Adding EQUELLA resources from within a Canvas module
EQUELLA resources can be added to a Canvas course module from the module itself. Using this method allows the user to add a single EQUELLA resource at a time, and that resource will be added to the course module the EQUELLA Select screen was accessed from.

2. Click the PLUS button beside the module the resource is to be added to. The Add item to Module name dialog opens.

# Adding EQUELLA resources to the Canvas HTML editors
The EQUELLA repository can be used as a search destination for content-creation functionality within Canvas. Images (and other resources) from EQUELLA can be added using Canvas’s HTML editor.

(Note: EQUELLA content can be accessed from any of the Canvas HTML editors. These HTML editors exist in a number of places in Canvas, and this guide will refer to just one of those.)
