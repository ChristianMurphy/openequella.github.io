# Release Notes for Equella 6.5-GA

*_In Progress_*

6.5-GA is the initial Open Source version of Equella.  Changes have focused on scrubbing the code to align with open source licensing.  The build process was also overhauled to use sbt (Simple Build Tool) and not require an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) to build / develop code.  No new features or bug fixes were included.
