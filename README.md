#Equella Web and Documentation
>Work in progress.

EQUELLA is a digital repository that provides a single platform to house your teaching and learning, research, media, and library content. 

EQUELLA has been deployed for copyright resource collections, research materials, managing and exposing materials through websites and portals, content authoring, workflow, institutional policy and organisational resources. EQUELLA is currently in use in a wide range of schools, universities, colleges, TAFEs, departments of education, government agencies, and corporations worldwide.

With over 10 years of history, EQUELLA is a mature solution written for the Java platform.  In its recent history, EQUELLA was proprietary software licensed to adopters by Pearson.  Currently EQUELLA is in the Apereo Incubation process, led by contributors from Unicon and Edalex Solutions.
