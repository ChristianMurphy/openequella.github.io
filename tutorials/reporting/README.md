This is a guide dedicated to helping you get the most out of the data contained in your EQUELLA institution(s).

It is intended to be the place to go to for:

-   How-To guides on writing a particular query
-   Picking the right dataset type for the job
-   Write the most efficient query for your database and EQUELLA instance
-   Learn about reports that other users  have created
-   Understanding the intricacies of the EQUELLA SQL schema - [Why does the EQUELLA schema make no sense?!](SchemaDesign.md)

## Tutorials

These tutorials are designed to be followed in order but more advanced report writers might like to skip ahead. 


### Querying using SQL

The SQL demonstrated in these tutorials can be used with reporting tools other than BIRT. 
We do specific datasource integration with BIRT but [see here](WithoutBIRT.md) for alternatives to those integrations.  

1. [Reporting tutorial schema](ReportingTutorialSchema.md)
2. [The basics - primary keys and UUIDs](TheBasics.md)
3. [Querying strings](QueryingStrings.md)
4. [Querying with Native XML type](QueryingXMLType.md)
5. [Querying repeated metadata](RepeatedMetadata.md)
