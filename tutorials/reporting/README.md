# Reporting wiki space

This is a space dedicated to helping you get the most out of the data 
contained in your EQUELLA institution(s).

It is intended to be the place to go to for:

-   Tutorials for writing a particular query
-   Help writing the most efficient query for your database and EQUELLA
 instance
-   Understanding the intricacies of the EQUELLA SQL schema - 
[Why does the EQUELLA schema make no sense?!](SchemaDesign.md)
-   Learn about reports that other users  have created
-   Picking the right dataset type for the job

## Tutorials

These tutorials are designed to be followed in order but more advanced 
report writers might like to skip ahead. 

### Querying using SQL

The SQL demonstrated in these tutorials can be used with reporting tools other than BIRT. 
We do specific datasource integration with BIRT but [see here](WithoutBIRT.md) for 
alternatives to those integrations.

You can see the results of the tutorials in action on the [betadev reporting](https://betadev.equella.net/reports/access/reports.do) 
institution which contains example BIRT reports containing the queries discussed in these tutorials.
